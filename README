arte-dl is a command line tool for downloading  embedded videos
from arte.tv to be able to view the stuff without having to use
Adobe Flash.

== Example ==

$ ./arte-dl (URL)+

e.g.

$ ./arte http://videos.arte.tv/de/videos/leben_ohne_schadstoffe_-3334834.html
Download leben_ohne_schadstoffe_-3334838.m4v (try: 0)
Download leben_ohne_schadstoffe_-3334838.m4v (try: 1)

== Motivation ==

Arte is this public television channel, payed by the people of
germany/france. Some content is available for 7 (sic!) days at
the website. But only viewable within a flash-application. There
are several reasons to avoid Adobe Flash like the black death.
E.g. uncountable security problems, the fact that it is
proprietary closed source software, non-availability for several
platforms and the mental-pain trying to imagine, why someone
would think that it is a good idea to use flash for distributing
videos.

== Background ==

The tool is written in python (2.6.5 works). As dependency the
tool flvstreamer (1.6 works) is needed, which is on current linux
distribution usually available (e.g. apt-get install
flvstreamer).

The license is GPL v3+.

The name is inspired by the nice tool youtube-dl 
( http://bitbucket.org/rg3/youtube-dl/wiki/Home ).
