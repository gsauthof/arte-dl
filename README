arte-dl is a command line tool for downloading embedded videos
from arte.tv to be able to view the stuff without having to use
Adobe Flash.

## Example ##

    $ ./arte-dl (URL)+

e.g.

    $ ./arte http://videos.arte.tv/de/videos/leben_ohne_schadstoffe_-3334834.html
    Download leben_ohne_schadstoffe_-3334838.m4v (try: 0)
    Download leben_ohne_schadstoffe_-3334838.m4v (try: 1)

## Motivation ##

Arte is this public television channel, payed by the people of
germany/france. Some content is available for 7 (sic!) days at
the website. But only viewable within a flash-application. There
are several reasons to avoid Adobe Flash like the black death.
E.g. uncountable security problems, the fact that it is
proprietary closed source software, non-availability for several
platforms and the mental-pain trying to imagine, why someone
would think that it is a good idea to use flash for distributing
videos.

## Background ##

The tool is written in python (2.6.5 works). As dependency the
tool flvstreamer (1.6 works) is needed, which is on current linux
distribution usually available (e.g. apt-get install
flvstreamer).

The license is GPL v3+.

The name is inspired by the nice tool [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

It looks like the [Mediathek Java GUI](http://zdfmediathk.sourceforge.net/index.html)
supports arte.tv content (didn't try it).

Someone wrote an [example php-script](http://www.galipe.net/example/plussept.php)
how to extract useful data from the arte feeds.

Some [french][1] [threads][2] mention a python GTK inteface for arte and
some totem integration:

## Troubleshooting ##

* In case the automatically derived destination filename is already present in
  the destination directory the script tries to finish a previous started
  download. If the existing file is unrelated this does not work. Remove the
  existing file then.

* Arte streams some rated videos only between 23h and 5h. The script tries to
  detect that. If this auto-detection fails the download does not work and the
  created file has to be removed before retrying.
